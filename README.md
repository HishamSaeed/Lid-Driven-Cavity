# Lid-Driven-Cavity
This repository contains a small solver to solve the problem of lid driven cavity, using c++, a small skeleton for the grid is implemented, the SOR is used for solving system of equations

# Running instructions

you need to build the project first then run
building instructions

``` mkdir build``` <br />
``` cd build\ ``` <br />
``` cmake .. ``` <br />
``` make ``` <br />
``` cd build\ ``` <br />

then run

``` ./sim ../cavity100.dat ```
