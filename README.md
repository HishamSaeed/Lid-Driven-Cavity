# Lid-Driven-Cavity
This repository contains a small solver to solve the problem of lid driven cavity, using c++, a small skeleton for the grid is implemented, the SOR is used for solving system of equations

you need to build the project first then run
building instructions

``` mkdir build```
``` cd build\ ```
``` cmake .. ```
``` make ```
``` cd build\ ```

then run
